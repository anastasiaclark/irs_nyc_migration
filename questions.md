# Some questions I have

* What do we want to show in graphs? Change over time in the top counties/metros that send/recieve migrants from NYC?
* Do we want to make flow maps or something else? 
  I did circular plots like in [this paper](http://www.global-migration.info/VID%20WP%20Visualising%20Migration%20Flow%20Data%20with%20Circular%20Plots.pdf) for Deborah's migration in Mexico paper. 
  But, I used R scrips described in the paper. So maybe not something you'd want but the paper has other tradtional flow
  maps that could be looked at.
* Some counties changed fips codes during this 4-year period, 
  if we want to track change in migration over time, we need to deal with this somehow.
* Is there dictionary for Census pop estimates? Most of the fields are self explanatory, but not all. Don't want to      misinterpret them.
