# data folder

The CSV files in the output_data folder include the primary summary output from the Jupyter notebooks: domestic migration inflows and outflows for NYC (counties) and NYMA (metro areas) as well as population estimate components of change for the counties within the New York City and Metro Areas. 

The other subfolders contain the original source data that was used for the project.
