# Migration Reports - Notes from Lit Review

## Fuller2017 Migration in DC region

- DC pop gains occurred from natural increase and net foreign migration while net domestic migration was negative.

- Paper looks at the DC metro area, not DC by itself.

- During 15 years between 2000 and 2015, when there were gains from net domestic migration the number of people leaving declined while the number entering remained stable. Decreased outflow was associated with periods where the region's job growth outpaced the rest of the nation.

- DC lost population to metros with strong job growth, to nearby metros with lower costs of living, and to metros that were attractive to retirees.

- DC gained people from geographically dispersed metros that had lagging job growth, smaller economies, or higher costs of living.

- Net foreign migration was stable throughout the period and was positive, resulting in net gains each year.

- Compared to natural increase, migration depends more on external factors like jobs, cost of living, and quality of life.

- Gains from net foreign migration were pretty stable and positive, while net domestic migration was variable; a few periods of gains alternating with sharp periods of decline.

- Domestic migrants tend to have higher labor force participation rates compared to foreign migrants. 

- 1st part of the report uses PEP and IRS data to examine migration flows. 2nd part uses ACS PUMS data to study characteristics of recent migrants.

- During periods of net gain, outflows declined while inflows were stable or increased modestly.

- Net domestic migration "is a function of the region's ability to attract new residents from elsewhere (inflows) and the region's ability to retain existing residents (outflows)". DC is able to attract new people but struggles to retain people.

- Change in IRS methodology resulted in large decrease in flows in 2014 and 2015 (something to watch out for).

- Net gain from foreign migration always larger than for domestic, despite the much smaller flow of foreign migrants.

- For domestic migration, the report splits metros into 3 different groups: the 14 largest (whether they were net senders or receivers), the top 15 smaller metros that were net senders, and the top 15 smaller metros that were net receivers.

- Combined, the 14 largest metros were net senders to DC but if you break them down 1/2 were net senders and 1/2 were net receivers. Net senders were big Northeastern and Midwestern cities, plus LA. Largest net receivers were in the South and on the West coast. Senders had weaker job growth while receivers had stronger job growth.

- Top 15 smaller senders were smaller cities scattered across the US that had weaker economies or a high cost of living. The top 15 receivers were lower cost and faster growing metros that were located in close proximity to DC or were in Florida.

- Challenges for the region: foreign migration is a key source of growth, but foreign migrants are less likely to be employed compared to domestic migrants. Upcoming wave of retiring baby boomers hitting retirement will likely lead to increase of out migration. Generation Z (after the Millennials) will be similar in size to Generation X: smaller than the Boomers and Millennials, so a smaller source of potential in migration. DC attracts new people but can't retain them, suggesting economic opportunity doesn't fully compensate for quality of life issues.

- In methodology section at the end: points out that IRS data in 2013/14 and 2014/15 will be revised sometime this year due to duplicate records in 2013/14 and unmatched flows in both sets of years.

- Starting in 2011/12 all members of a household were matched, allowing for changes of family structure to appear in the flows. In particular the matching of 1st time tax filers who had previously been dependents. Change in status of filers (from marriage and divorce) and 1st time filers (college grads with first jobs) are likely movers, so years of data prior to 2011/12 likely underestimate # of movers.

- Report covers the big 3 datasets: IRS, PEP, and ACS. 

- IRS data excludes filers who can't be matched between years. To understand this, the total number of tax exemptions from the IRS County Migration Income Summary was compared to the number of exemptions in the migration data. Between 2000 and 2014 about 90% of people covered by tax returns were matched for DC; for the US as a whole the rate is almost 95%.

- IRS also excludes households that do not file taxes. Because of these exclusions, the ACS in migration and out migration flows are higher during 2012-14. After 2014 they diverge sharply; IRS attributes this to greater identity theft detection methods which results in fewer moves.

- PEP is considered to be the most comprehensive and better compared to either IRS or ACS.

- For DC, ACS net migration loss is always much higher than the other sources, while IRS is always much lower. PEP is in-between.

- IRS data significantly underestimates foreign migration; the PEP foreign migration numbers are always significantly higher than what the IRS reports. To look at net foreign migration change, this report uses the PEP. While living abroad, most households only file taxes in the country where income was earned. A move is only recorded if two consecutive years of returns are available; for foreign migrants one of those years is a year when they lived abroad.

## Pew2010 and Pew2016 Philly migration

- 1st report uses PEP and IRS to look at flows while 2nd report looks more at ACS to understand characteristics of migrants. 

- Unlike the DC report, the Philly report is more concerned with the city itself and it's interactions with the surrounding suburban counties.

- More people leave Philly than arrive; a long time trend. But the net outflow has declined substantially over the study period 1993-2008, to the point were natural increase and foreign net migration have led to modest population growth.

- Half of the net outflow for Philly in 2008 was to suburban counties in PA and NJ. 

- Many cities show a similar pattern; new outflow in domestic migration offset by natural increase and foreign migration.

- Net out migration to Philly suburbs in PA has declined, primarily due to an increase of suburbanites moving into the city. The number of city dwellers moving to the suburbs has remained stable.

- Net out migration to Philly suburbs in NJ has declined even more dramatically. By 2008 outflow was at the lowest point in the study period; declining outflow to NJ and an increasing inflow to the city.

- Report looked at the churn rate compared to other cities; i.e. the number of movers as a percentage of the total population. Philly had one of the lowest rates at 6.1% NYC 8.3%. Denver highest at 17% and LA lowest at 4.5%.

- During the study period more people moved from NYC to Philly than vice versa. By the end of the study period net change to Philly still positive but had declined, as there was an increase in Philadelphians moving to NYC.

- In 1993 58% of Philly out migrants moved to another county within the Philly metro area. By 2008 this had dropped to 52%; more people leaving the metro.

## IBO2008 NYC Migration patterns

- Report begins by noting the importance of migration to city tax revenue.

- The IBO chose to refer to tax filers as opposed to migrants or movers, and used filers rather than exemptions (unlike the DC and Philly reports). They did look at average exemptions per tax filer in order to estimate household size, i.e. families with children.

- Between 1989 and 2007 the nearby suburban counties were the biggest and most important senders and receivers, but over time the importance of more distant places increased. 

- Since 1990 the migration of tax filers into NYC has increased, but the number moving out has also increased. The growth in arrivals outpaced the growth in departures so net out migration has declined. In 2007 the net loss was 17,500 filers, down from 49,200. In migration grew more quickly than out migration as the labor market was strong.

- (As in the other cities, net change is influenced by growth or decline of inflow relative to outflow).

- They equate the number of exemptions claimed in a return with the number of people represented by the return in the household (common practice).

- Over time, moves from and to other parts of NY state declined, with out migration always higher than in migration between NYC and NYS. Nassau, Westchester, and Suffolk are consistently the top sending and receiving counties (still true today). For NJ, Hudson and Bergen were the most important senders and receivers. The percentage of NYC residents who left to go to other counties in the metro declined from 40% to 35% of total, while migrants from the metro counties to NYC declined from 48% to 28%. Both reflect growing influence of distant places.

- Florida has long been the 3rd most popular destination as a state. Pennsylvania has been the 4th most popular choice but has grown in importance over the years. Massachusetts was the most significant, but still small (in terms of net flow) source of net in migration to the city. Hypothesis is the large number of college graduates from the Boston area. 

- They provide a good explanation of who gets missed in the IRS data, but this explanation no longer fully applies to data released since the report came out (2011/12 forward, when methodology changed). Because the IRS requires two consecutive years of tax returns in order to be recorded in the files, the following are missed: workers in their 1st year of employment, workers who take a break from work for more than a year, filers who die, first-time joint filers, and immigrants and emigrants who don't file when they move to or return from living abroad. Using NYS tax returns, they estimate that about 10% of NYC flows are not counted in the IRS migration files.
