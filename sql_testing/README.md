# sql_testing folder

Scripts and data in this folder were written during the early stages of the project. Ultimately the data they produced was used to independently verify the results of the IRS migration Jupyter Notebook. The Notebooks used Pandas while these scripts used SQL via the sqlite3 module to generate the same output.
